          <h3><u>About our Project</u></h3>
          <p>Our project’s primary concept is to utilize Yelp data (from Kaggle) and population data (from the Census Bureau) to help entrepreneurs find optimal locations to start businesses. We envision a map that will display the results of our processes for determining which business categories are recommended in a particular area. Our process will consider the Yelp data of businesses in each zip code (including business categories like barber shop, Mexican restaurant, coffee shop, etc.) and compare the number of businesses in each zip code to the zip code populations. Then it will compute for each zip code the average number of businesses in each category per capita and compare it to the average over the dataset for that category. For example, if someone were trying to decide where in a city to start a coffee shop, the map could indicate that a certain zip code has twice the number of coffee shops per capita than the average, while a zip   code across the city with far below the average number of coffee shops per capita might be a better opportunity.
