       "'Super simple place but amazing nonetheless. It\\'s been around since the 30\\'s and they still serve the same thing they started with: a bologna and salami sandwich with mustard. \\n\\nStaff was very helpful and friendly.*The shop was featured on Mind of a Chef with Anthony Bourdain and David Chang of Momofuku\\n*Note that if you don\\'t like mustard, do not come to this place. They will not take out the mustard or cut the sandwich in half for you, that\\'s just how they have been serving since 1932! \\n*this is more of a grab-and-go place. \\n*The staff behind the counter were friendly and happy to discuss about the shop and its history. \\n*there aren\\'t any fancy plates utensils here. All the sandwiches were served on a napkin or in a brown bag.\\n\\n-Wilensky\\'s special (made with all-beef bologna and salami and swiss cheese) - $5\\nThe sandwich was GLORIOUS. So simple yet so good. If you don\\'t know what kind of cheese to choose, I would recommend the swiss cheese over the cheddar as the former is a bit milder, which would enhances the flavor of the sandwich. I regret not ordering the pickles and their soda as I heard Wilensky has syrups in house that they mix with soda, and there are so many flavors to choose from!As its name suggests, Wilensky\\'s is a lunch counter--one that\\'s only open until 4:00, weekdays and Saturdays.  It\\'s now celebrating its 80th anniversary (going on 81), and with few exceptions it looks like its been preserved in amber since the \\'40s. \\n\\nOne of Montreal\\'s few truly great sandwiches, and a certified original, the Wilensky Special is still priced under $5. So what if it\\'s simply a pressed hot bologna and salami sandwich with mustard? Some days nothing else comes close. I recommend ordering yours with Kraft cheese and a side order of half-sours to get the full experience.  And don\\'t forget to order a fountain drink.  \\n\\nAn institution (sometimes in more than one sense), and not just because of The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz.  Beware of imitators--this is the real deal.Stopped by for the Wilensky\\'s Special, loved it and almost shed a tear after taking my last bite. Delicious, reasonably priced and simple. I can\\'t wait to go back again and again. The staff are no nonsense, genuine and the decor is very charming. Would highly recommend!I have to admit, I am a fan. Just entering there, you know that time has stopped in place many, many years ago. \\n\\nIt certainly is not a classy place. It is not gourmet at all. And its name doesn\\'t suit the place at all: it is NOT a light lunch. However, it a true Montreal institution and a classic.\\n\\nWhen you go there, there is only thing to order, really: the Wilensky Special. Bread with salami and bologna and mustard. You take two of those along with a cherry coke and a sour pickle and you\\'re good to go. It\\'s open from 10am to 4pm, weekdays only. \\n\\nAnd you have to remember the rules:\\n\\n\"When ordering a special\\nYou should know a thing or two\\nThey are always served with mustard\\nThey are never cut in two\\nDon\\'t ask us why, just understand\\nThat this is nothing new\\nThis is the way that it\\'s been done since 1932.\" \\n\\nOh, and don\\'t dare you give them some tip.Went here while visiting Montreal. It was great! So simple yet delicious. Had the special with cheese and cherry cola. Gotta have the cherry cola.  Also had the half sour pickle, next time trying the sour pickle instead. Only cash.This place is disgusting. The components of my hotdog were handled by three separate people all of who were not wearing any gloves. The old guy who cooked the hotdogs kept coughing into his fist as he stood directly over the grill, coughing into the same bare hand that he used to rotate the dog to another side. I was appalled watching this unfold and kept my mouth shut because 1. I was curious just how gross it could get and 2. I don\\'t want to give anymore of a reason for these French fcks to dislike Americans. I didn\\'t want to add \"bitches about how I make food\" to their reasons they can be rude. Will. Not. Go. Back. Ever. I took it to go then threw them in the garbage on the street.For 70 years they have been making the signature sandwich the same way.  Take it as served or not at all.  It is that simple.  If you put aside any food snobbery and just go with it, you will be rewarded with a delicious sandwich that will tickle your taste buds.  Add to it a home made sofa or egg cream and you will be in heaven.  Still owned by the founder\\'s granddaughter, who is gracious and charming, Wilensky\\'s is a total throwback.  Tiny, with only 10 stools, the interior is the same as it was in 1952 when the restaurant moved one block to its present location - well, they have updated the titles in their lending library.  Simply magnificent.After hearing so many things about this famed place from various food critics and personalities, I finally decided, on a particularly humid Montréal day, to check out this place for myself and see if it was worth all the hype. I proceeded to order the most common meal here - a cherry coke, a Special with Swiss, and a sour pickle. In my opinion, everything was A-ok, and upon first glance it stereotypically looked like what I jokingly call \"white people food,\" except it was actually pretty good and tasted better than it looked. \\n\\nAs someone who doesn\\'t particularly like lunch meats, the bologna was actually pretty tasty and the Swiss cheese\\\\/bread combination complemented it nicely. The mustard, however, didn\\'t come through for whatever reason. Maybe the sourness of the pickle I was eating at the same time ended up drowning out the flavor? I don\\'t know, but it was a bit disappointed given that mustard is one of my favorite Western condiments. As for the cherry cola, classic fountain drinks always give me a cool vibe, as if it could make a person cooler just by drinking out of a glass of it. For a place with so much history to it, it didn\\'t disappoint on that aspect.\\n\\nOverall, come here for the old-school vibe if you\\'re in the mood for a throwback and some simple, cheap eats. Maybe I\\'ll go back and see if I can actually taste the mustard in the future...Wilenski\\'s is an important reminder of Montreal heritage. The Wilenski Special is the type of sandwich your parents would make you after school. It\\'s simple and taste great. When I ate here, there were plenty of kids at the counter so popular with the youngsters for sure. While the decor is minimalist, the place is an iconic image of Montreal and the people who have frequented this place since the 30\\'s.My grandfather took my dad when he was a kid, and now he takes us. He tells us that this place hasn\\'t ever changed, and I agree. The walls are filled with magazine articles and pictures, and the stools at the counter look pretty much the same. There\\'s only one thing that people  order, the Special, a salami and bologna sandwich with mustard. Yes, you have to take the mustard, there\\'s even a sign saying that. You can order one of their fountain sodas, and get a side of pickles. This place has a crazy charm to it. The waiters are very friendly, and the food is always very quick and tasty. This place is definitely a Montreal classic.As you enter Wilensky\\'s you\\'re transported to a bygone era.  Fading photos smile at you from the walls.  A cash register from the late 1800\\'s, built to last a millenia sits quietly beside the entrance.  If it rang more than its $1.95 maximum, I could imagine it still in use.\\n\\nThe staff behind the counter are welcoming, friendly and are happy to discuss the occasional question about the shop and its history.  But, some things won\\'t happen, at any price. Cutting your sandwich in half, exchanging bun types: forget about it.  Just sit, order, eat, drink, chat and enjoy.\\n\\nService is exceptionally quick.  You\\'ll have your Wilensky special sandwich with or without Kraft or swiss slice, always with mustard, by about the time you finishing uttering your order.\\n\\nSodas are hand made with syrups from behind the counter, ladled and stirred in front of you.\\n\\nAny tipping goes straight into a donation jar for charity, not to the house.\\n\\nHours are 9-4pm if I remember correctly.\\n\\nThe nostalgia of this shop is unmatched and worth a stop for any visitor or resident of Montreal.Nothing special besides the nostalgic look of this place.  A small sandwich for $5.  And since it\\'s in a touristy spot, a few couples came and ordered one sandwich to share between them. Apparently some guy behind the counter wasn\\'t too happy with that. You don\\'s miss much if you skip this place in Montreal.Get the special with swiss along with a chocolate egg cream. Very tasty! \\n\\nSuper friendly staff, as well.This is a great little spot for a quick light lunch. It\\'s totally hyped - and not glamorous in person, but I truly enjoyed my Wilensky Special + swiss cheese, and a side of pickle and beef karnatzl. They make their own flavoured soda on the spot which is kind of neat. I had the cherry coke and was happy with it. my bill came to 8.05 with tax. Not too shabby!Le 4 étoiles ici est pour l\\'expérience globale. J\\'ai passé de nombreuses fois devant ce restaurant, car il est à côté de la piste cyclable, sans jamais le remarquer. \\n\\nJ\\'ai vu les chefs David Chang et ceux de Joe Beef y passer dans l\\'émission \"Mind of a chef\" et j\\'étais très curieux d\\'essayer. \\n\\nEn rentrant dans le restaurant, on a l\\'impression d\\'être à une autre époque avec le décor qui ne semble pas avoir été changé. \\n\\nIl était 10h30, alors j\\'étais le seul client. L\\'accueil était sympathique. Sharon Wilensky était souriante. On m\\'a proposé les deux types de cornichons, on a amené des saucissons.\\n\\nCôté nourriture, c\\'est plus du \"confort food\" qu\\'autre chose. La nourriture est bonne, le Bologne est coupé au fur et à mesure. Le pain Kaiser est pressé dans un grill style panini. Il manque un peu de goût, j\\'ai ajouté de la moutarde, malgré qu\\'il en avait déjà. Les à côté comme les chips Miss Vickie\\'s sont 1$, très abordable. La root beer est disponible. \\n\\nUne belle place pour y aller entre amis après une journée de travailI got a Wilensky Special All Beef Salami and Bologna sandwich with Swiss cheese and mustard, pickles on the side and their homemade cherry coke. Everything worked together perfectly.\\nThe sandwich is simple yet so damn good. \\nReminded me of the Mortadella Sandwich I had at the Municipal Market in São Paulo, Brazil.\\nFor $3.90 a sandwich it\\'s definitely worth dropping by!!Family owned restaurant that\\'s been around since the beginning of time.  Their location looks very nostalgic, with everything looking like it hasn\\'t changed since they first opened.  (except the rack of 80\\'s music cds).   They\\'re known for their Wilenksy special.  It\\'s a beef bologna sandwich with mustard and it\\'s pressed flat like a panini.  Good sandwich, but nothing i would crave.First off, don\\'t come here expecting high gastronomy. This is a workers lunch and it\\'s pretty clear. If you accept this and that this is not a healthy lunch, you can be satisfied with the lunch at wilensky\\'s.\\n\\nI walked there from my office and took it to go. I had 2 special wilensky\\'s sandwich, one with Swiss cheese and one with no cheese. If you are hesitating between the two, my answer is simple: go with the one with cheese. The standard one is a good comfort food but the one with cheese is so much better. The cheese melts completely and the taste of Swiss goes really well with the salami if the sandwich.\\n\\nAlso try their soft drink. They are homemade and tastes really good. One warning though, don\\'t expect it to taste like your commercial version of the drinks like Coca-Cola or Pepsi.the taste is different but it\\'s really goodSi cute ! Si charmant ! \\n\\nLe décor ancestral date du début du 20e siècle et la charmante dame de 91 ans qui sert derrière son comptoir est la femme du défunt propriétaire. J\\'adore l\\'endroit. C\\'est tout petit, tout intime, Je recommande le fameux Wilensky\\'s special, qui consiste en : du baloney, de la moutarde jaune (obligé d\\'en mettre!!), fromage et du pain hamburger, le tout pressé, écrasé comme un vieux grilled cheese. A déguster avec un \"lemon soda\" qui est vert pomme et délicieusement sucré.\\n\\nC\\'est plus qu\\'un petit resto de quartier, c\\'est une institution, carrément !Pour un excellent sandwich salami et Bologne, je vous recommande vivement ce restaurant. Un décor des années 30, on a vraiment l\\'impression de remonter dans le temps. Ne cherchez pas le confort, vous trouverez pas. Cet endroit est un resto rapide. Je vous recommande, ne serait-ce que pour l\\'expérience !Still the best. It\\'s amazing how they can make such a simple sandwich taste like the best thing you\\'ve ever eaten.This will be the most useless review you\\'ll ever read on Yelp:\\n\\nGo here. Get the special. Enjoy.\\n\\nThe end.Not a fancy place, but so good! We actually ate here twice while in Montreal. During our first visit, we ordered the Wilensky Special - one with swiss and another with cheddar - and a cherry soda (loved that they use old school syrup). Would personally give the slight edge to the Special with cheddar, but both were tasty and satisfying. \\n\\nService was efficient and I enjoyed the original decor. As mentioned, we came back the next day for another Special after an underwhelming experience at Fairmount Bagel.After a late breakfast at Faberge , decided to walk around and discover this pretty street called Fairmont! Saw this spot looked retro,dated! I had to go in! First Thing  I noticed was books for sale for a buck! I then saw a counter and people and I realized that I was a restaurant \\\\/ grab n go spot! \\n\\nSince I wasn\\'t hungry I opted for a strawberry milkshake! It was only 2.17$ !!!\\n\\nThe place is cool in it\\'s own way! I love places where there\\'s history! The walls were jam packed with that. \\n\\nStaff was extremely nice! Family owned I like I like\\n\\nAs for the milkshake is was basic no fuss and hit the spot! I have to definitely go back for their sandwiches!\\n\\nBy the way there\\'s only stools at the counter and sits about 10-15 people! If you are in the area and it\\'s still open check it out!Classic place. Been around for 60+ years. Best Bologna sandwich there is. Eat with mustard only and sit at the bar.Unpleasant, dirty place. Other than that their special is nothing special, and milk shakes are too sugary. Cherry coke is OK though. Oh, and it\\'s cash only.I love this Montreal staple... It appears to be preserved and unchanged for over 80 years.  And it\\'s still family owned. I was served by the original owners grand daughter.Simple but great sandwiches.  If I say that they are made with baloney and mustard, you may not be impressed. Yet, each time I return to Montreal I HAVE to stop here.  Somehow, I think the fact the place has not changed in close to a century makes it very warm and homey.  Please make sure you have one of their old style sodas. Made with sirup and added carbonated water.  I suggest a cherry coke.  The only way I\\'ll stop coming is if they change the menu and provide WIFI.Stopped in for lunch while in town for the jazz fest.\\n\\nThe Special was as advertised: cheap and delicious. And they make it super fast--like 10 seconds fast. So good I got one for the road. And the phat Slim Jim beef jerky thing was awesome for 60 cents, too.\\n\\nOverall, a Montreal institution for 80 years that\\'s well worth checking out. Will definitely be back.Saw this place on Mind of a Chef just the night before while we were visiting Montreal so we had to hit it up! They serve only one thing, but they serve it right. Had already visited the infamous Schwart\\'s days prior and although I know they\\'re two different sandwiches, Wilensky\\'s sandwich tasted WAY better. The place is outdated, but full of character. There\\'s maybe like 10 stools at the bar and you eat there. Up close and personal to the servers who are wonderful people. The sandwich looks dinky and lame but the bun is WARM (unlike Schwart\\'s) and when you bite into it...oh man is it tasty. We even ordered one to bring back to Vancouver (since we were leaving that day)! A must-visit!The special with swiss is the way to go to my mind.  They have been doing it forever.  The owner said though that they\\'ve been selling way more with cheddar since the mind of a chef show was there.  But swiss, for sure the swiss.  Also go with the full sour pickles as well.  Don\\'t even mess with the half sour, because who wants a half strength picked?  \\n\\nLots of childhood memories come back with the special.  Not because I\\'ve been here before but I remember by dad making grilled balcony and cheese sandwiches.  So on that level this place might rock your world if it tricks some childhood issues.  \\n\\nBut how do you rate an Institution with such a long history that awakens nostalgia?  Really , you probably can\\'t and be honest.  Part of you will want to rate high just because of the history and the fact that it is a very damn fine sandwich.  And there is probably some small part of you whispering to try and not rate it high due to some food snobbery or other issues or just being contrary.  For me, this place is something everyone should try once no matter what.  For some of you it will be 5 star and bring back childhood memories and for others you might not understand.  That is fine, but like I said everyone should go at least once.  But why 4 stars and not 5?  For me 5 has to be transcendent or reproducibly great.  I\\'ve only been once.  When I go back, I\\'ll bump them up to 5 stars.  Not like this one review is going to make or break them.  But go before the neighbor hood changes or the next generation gets crazy ideas.A must-try place if visiting from out of town!\\n\\nThe typical order is the \"Wilensky\\'s Special\". It\\'s an all-beef salami and all-beef Bologna, grilled, in a roll with mustard.  You may ask to have it with Kraft singles cheese or Swiss.   (You cannot ask to have it cut in half, or without mustard).\\n\\nThe decor is nostalgic; photos of loyal customers since its opening in 1932.  Seating is only at the counter, thus, limited seats.  But don\\'t worry, you can take it to go. It\\'s a fast eat.  If you really need seats, then know that the turnaround time is quick; nobody lingers.\\n\\nThe food is made upon ordering.  It arrives quickly and hot - the sandwiches are served on a napkin.  Tip: order each sandwich as you go, no need to order all 2 or 3 for yourself at once!  The soda fountain is real old-school!  Syrup form!  Many flavours to choose from!  You can separately order pickles - sour or half sour.  The karnatzels are very fresh too.\\n\\nOverall, the staff is warm and friendly.  This place is highly recommended for a quick bite to eat.  The sandwiches are done just right.The Special doesn\\'t seem all that special--what, surprise luncheon meat grilled with some mustard and maybe cheese? But damn is it good, and the hand-mixed soda with it. It\\'s small and not very filling, though, true to the name of the restaurant. Munch on one of those little Slim Jim-lookin\\' things too, while you\\'re at it.\\n\\nMustard-haters, don\\'t worry about the strict requirement that the mustard goes in your sandwich. They don\\'t put in enough to clear the sinuses of a baby hamster.I couldn\\'t believe how much I loved this sandwich. Look at that photo. It looks so ordinary, but it\\'s so perfect. \\n\\nWe walked in right at 9am, and the perfectly grumpy guy behind the counter had to take our order like 5 times before it registered in his brain. For West-coasters who have only seen this behavior in movies, it was so delightfully spot on. The truly hilarious part: there was nothing about our order that was hard to remember. We each got a Wilensky special with Swiss, a pickle, and a cherry cola (that\\'s the order 99% of their clientele always get). It was so funny. The important part is that he got it right, and cooked it right. \\n\\nPastrami, bologna, yellow mustard, all pressed into a roll...thing. Looks like an English muffin. Tastes like...not...that. Whatever. It\\'s good. It\\'s served not on a plate, but on a thin napkin on the counter in front of you. \\n\\nThe man behind the counter warmed up to us and told us the story behind the place. We chatted about Portland and Montreal for a good 15 minutes as we were the only ones there at 9am (by the way, this sandwich makes a great breakfast). If I sound like I\\'m complaining about that guy, I\\'m not. The man is a true gem. \\n\\nAs others have pointed out, there\\'s no substitutions allowed. None are needed. You just have to trust that they know what they\\'re doing.This is a cute, historic restaurant that makes you feel like you\\'re stepping back in time when you enter. Sit at the counter and get a Wilensky\\'s Special (grilled sandwich with salami, beef bologna, mustard, and cheese), which they\\'ve been making since 1932. We each got one along with a sour pickle and also shared an old-fashioned cream soda. The sandwich is pretty good, and the staff is very friendly. We\\'re glad we went.I found this place while I was at the Laundromat down the street. I had never heard of it (I am from out of town). I thought it looked pretty cool. It is cool. The special is fried bologna and salami with mustard and cheese (optional). What could be better.I can\\'t believe this place has only 65 reviews!\\nAs far as I\\'m concerned, Wilensky\\'s hype is on the same level as Schwartz\\'s - except that the former stayed humble, and the later built a whole empire that boasts worldwide renown and Celine Dion. The Wilensky Special is just a grilled bologna sandwich, plain and simple. It can only be praised so much for its culinary achievements, but can be adored endlessly if you happen to be fond of the diner\\'s cultural significance and nostalgic vibe.\\n\\nWilensky is frozen in time, with its funny wall color, cheap prices and casual chit chat. There\\'s no huge lineup out the door, obnoxious service or sense of urgency - althought the hype whipped up by Anthony Bourdain and others has given the place a strange sacred aura. The first time I stepped into the place, I thought it was surprisingly old, like a museum that refuses to modernize. They didn\\'t really ride any wave of the publicity, and you\\'ll never find their bologna sandwich sold anywhere outside of their shop - and I think I like them for that.\\n\\nIt seems that Wilensky is still a well kept secret - one of many hidden around the Plateau and Mile-End. It earned its place by staying consistently delicious, close to its community and true to its origins and family values.\\n\\nNote: I usually don\\'t like soda, but I actually really enjoyed theirs!I don\\'t know what the craze is. The whole sandwich is just really underwhelming. It\\'s exactly what you think it would be - a small, greasy mystery meat sandwich for $4.50. They do, however, have cherry cola and the overall place is really cool.The history of the Jewish community in Montreal is well documented in the books of  Mordecai Richler, one of the most important Canadian writers. His famous novel \"The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz\" was also a made into a successful film under the same name.  Wilensky\\'s is present in both the book and film. It was founded by Moe Wilensky in 1932. The family says Moe\\'s father opened a hair salon down the street and sold snacks and sandwiches on the side. One day the Moe bought a panini press for $ 68, which is worth about a 1,000$ a day. His father was shocked by his decision to spend so much money on an electric device, but thanks to it Moe invented the Wilensky special\" -  a grilled beef salami and beef bologna sandwich with mustard on a kaiser roll, pressed flat on the grill. The place is a time capsule for diners of the 30\\'s and they keep it the same as a principles: It\\'s impossible to get the toast without mustard, they never cut the toast in half and employees are not willing to accept a tip. Celebrity chef, Anthony Bourdain visits the place in almost every documented to Montreal. This will not be a transcendental experience for the taste buds Yet the old deli, the lines of pressed sandwiches on the grill, decorated by very yellow mustard, and the home-made soda drinks makes you feel like in a live food museum- and that\\'s worth every penny.I\\'m only giving it a 1 because you can\\'t give a 0 on Yelp. Nasty fried bologna sandwich, flat pop, staff that watches you when you eat, basically hovering over you.....pressure you to order more, etc.....no thanks! Great location, nice old vintage look to it.Their special sandwich is simplest sandwich ever and SO good: a roll with bologna, salami, cheese (swiss or cheddar) with mustard on a flat, grilled roll.\\n\\nI never even loved mustard until I tried it on this sandwich. It really adds so much to the sandwich. \\n\\nLine moved quick, sandwiches were cheap, AND I was pretty full.\\n\\nThe sandwich will make you feel nostalgic, and so will the décor. Full of old school CDs and books.Thinly sliced and seasoned bologna and salami between a perfectly toasted roll with a hint of mustard and melted America. cheese. The Special is one of best sandwiches in Montreal. \\n\\nWe were served by the current owner Sharon, who clearly has a love of the establishment and chatted with us about its history. Wilensky\\'s is everything you want in no frills dining.J\\'avoue n\\'avoir jamais compris cet intérêt autour de ce snack-bar du Mile-End. Chez Wilenskys Light Lunch tout est ordinaire : la nourriture, le menu, le personnel et le service. Pour 3.90$ (taxes non incluses), la famille Wilenskys vous servira, sans sourire ni politesse, la spécialité de la place : un sandwich au saucisson de Bologne. On parle ici d\\'un pain kaiser aplati (d\\'une catégorie difficile à décrire) à l\\'intérieur duquel vous trouverez quelques minces tranches de \" baloney \" accompagné d\\'une lichette de moutarde jaune. Les plus excentriques choisiront d\\'y ajouter une tranche de fromage. Pour le reste, les options s\\'amenuisent, car le menu est limité. Très limité. N\\'espérez pas manger des frites ici.  \\n\\nLe sandwich ne remplit pas l\\'estomac, loin de là. Pour espérer en faire un repas, il faut en commander au moins deux, sinon trois. Vous pourrez y ajouter un Cherry Coke tiré de la fontaine. Pour deux \" Wilensky Spécial \" et une boisson gazeuse, vous devrez cracher une douzaine de dollars. Pour le même prix, un resto du coin vous offrira un spécial du midi convenable. \\n\\nLe seul intérêt de l\\'endroit repose sur son côté historique. Le restaurant, fondé en 1932 par une famille immigrante de Russie, se trouve à la même adresse depuis les années 50. Le décor reste inchangé depuis plusieurs années. La place fut l\\'un des endroits préférés du défunt écrivain montréalais Mordecai Richler.\\n\\nConclusion : J\\'ai toujours cru qu\\'une visite au restaurant ne se limite pas qu\\'à regarder un joli décor (historique ou non). La bouffe doit être bonne et les prix raisonnables en raison de ce que l\\'on vous sert. Pour cette raison, évitez Wilensky autant que possible.Founded in the Mile End in 1932, and in the current spot since 1952, Wilensky\\'s Light Lunch is an institution which lots of us Montrealers are deeply fond of. Most read Mordechai Richler\\'s \"The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz\" in high school and since several scenes take place in Wilensky\\'s, and scenes in the 1974 film version starring Richard Dreyfuss were actually shot there, it looms in our nostalgic imaginations. The best part about it is that neither time nor local fame have changed it. You sit at the counter and are welcome. The Wilensky special or the hot dog is quickly pressed for you and slid down the counter with precision on a napkin. The soda is mixed fresh for you right before your eyes, and in quiet friendly contemplation you can read the history taped across the walls.Yum. Read everyone\\'s reviews and follow their advice. \\nCherry coke is tasty and old school and reminds me of the classic drug store soda counter of my youth. \\nTheir signature sandwich is fairly straightforward and delicious. \\nFriendly staff to boot.Un classique du Mile-End ! On se replonge dans le passé chez Wilensky, on prend un spécial + un cherry coke, effectivement, c\\'est bon et pas cher. Ils ont aussi des hot-dogs.I know this place has a following. Some people think it\\'s a Montreal landmark in the food category. But I don\\'t get it. It\\'s a seared baloney sandwich. It\\'s to Montreal what spam is to Hawaii. Do you yearn for spam? If yes, by all means go to Wilensky\\'s. Otherwise, I\\'d pass. In all states of the world, good Montreal smoked meat dominates - first time and millionth time.Great place to really experience the history of Montreal, the history of Canada, and food that has been made the same for over 70 years. \\n\\nSpecial with Kraft was delicious. In front of me within 1 minute of my order. \\nNot too salty and light on the mustard. I added more mustard and it hit the spot.\\n\\nChatted with the owner about the show being on The Mind of A Chef with David Chang. We talked about the history of the place and it was clear the amount of pride the family takes in running the shop. \\n\\nThe big surprise for me was the original soda fountain they have. \\nBest pineappple soda I ever had. Cherry looked amazing as well. \\n\\nA definite must-visit, if going to Montreal.4.8\\\\/5 I love everything about this place! EVERYTHING! Once you walk in to this little gem, I felt instantly transported back in time! With the old school swivel stools, the worn out table, house made sodas, the retro decor and them salami bologna sandwich! \\n\\nDon\\'t feel intimidated when you first walk in... go straight to the front and ask for the Wilensky special! Add a pickle on the side and grab one of their homemade sodas! \\nI had to take off one star because I\\'m not a big fan of the cornmeal dusted bread. I would preferred everything about the bread minus the cornmeal. But BRAVO for everything else!\\n\\nEat it on the go or if it\\'s not busy grab a seat! You won\\'t be disappointed!Wilensky\\'s is a tough place to review. While in Montreal, I ate at Joe Beef and Au Pied du Cochon. To review those places in the same frame of mind as Wilensky\\'s is unfair. They are striving to accomplish different goals. Here, you\\'ll get an unpretentious, straightforward lunch at incredible speed. You\\'ll enjoy the vibe. The food isn\\'t mind blowing, but is very tasty, in a simple, no frills sort of way.\\n\\nFirst, the neighborhood Wilensky\\'s is in is awesome. If you\\'re a tourist in Montreal, come here and walk around for a non tourist vibe. Enjoy a special, grab a coffee at Arts Cafe, and then eat again at Fairmont Bagel. \\n\\nNext, the food and drink. The Wilensky Special is salami and bologna served on a toasted roll, topped with mustard. It\\'s a simple sandwich, but it will hit you in all the right spots. It\\'s ready in less than a minute, and you\\'ll likely want two. Order a cherry soda with it - Wilensky has syrups in house that they mix with soda, and it\\'s very tasty, even if you don\\'t drink soda.\\n\\nFinally, the ambiance. This place is a classic - 1930\\'s era posters cover the wall, all seats are at a bar facing the griddle. Sitting at the bar, chatting with the owner (who is very nice, and patiently answered two questions about Anthony Bourdain while I was there), gives a very relaxing, small town feeling.\\n\\nCome here and enjoy the sandwich. But more so, enjoy the classic, friendly neighborhood vibe it gives off. It\\'ll set the tone for your day.Wilensky\\'s is definitely worth visiting for the nostalgic factor. Opens since 1932 and still family own and run by the Wilensky\\'s!\\n\\nAnd of course we need to order their famous SPECIAL ($3.90)! which is a grilled beef salami and beef bologna sandwich with mustard on a kaiser roll, pressed flat from the grill!\\n\\nAs the sign in the restaurant announces:\\n\\n\"When ordering a Special,\\nyou should know a thing or two.\\nIt is always served with mustard;\\nit is never cut in two.\\nDon\\'t ask us why; just understand\\nthat this is nothing new.\\nThis is the way that it\\'s been done\\nsince 1932.\"\\n\\nSo we ended up having our own SPECIAL since it is the way it has to be and luckily I love mustard!!\\n\\nThe Special is great for a snack and it is so hot!! So be careful when you bite into it!\\n\\nThe made to order fountain drinks with quite a few different flavours: even a chocolate one!! definitely worth ordering and believe me would go well with your sandwich!\\n\\nNo tips necessary but if you do, it will be put into donation box for the Heart and Stroke Foundation! So do leave whatever change you want to on the counter!\\n\\n.The Wilensky special tastes like what bologna, white bread, and mustard put together would taste like. There really was nothing special about this place or the food. I don\\'t know why there is such a hype. Don\\'t go out of your way but if you do, make sure you\\'re paying with Canadian dollars. The exchange rate is 1 to 1, and she won\\'t give you American dollars back for change. Overall, it was not a great experience.Great old time place with only a few stools. Make sure to try some of their home-made sodas...fantastic and you can mix flavours!\\n\\nAlso, this place discourages tipping.On y va pour la nostalgie. Je prends toujours le classique sandwich grillé avec muff anglais avec salami et baloneyExcellent salami\\\\/bologna sandwich, pressed warm with a real egg cream soda.  All the soda flavors are unique as they make their own syrups.  Excellent valueWilensky\\'s has been around since \\'32 and was opened up by Moe Wilensky.  Originally located on St. Urbain and Fairmount, the restaurant has been at its current location since \\'52.  It\\'s currently run by the wife, Ruth, and her children, Asher and Sharon.  The hubs and I came here and we were surprised at how it seemed as if we traveled back in time.  There was only counter seating, so we just made ourselves comfortable on the stools.  They are famous for their \\'Special,\\' which is grilled beef salami and grilled beef bologna, topped with mustard, all set on a kaiser roll, which is then pressed flat on the grill - you can have a side of sweet or sour pickles (I recommend the sour) - it was a lovely combination!  The sandwich itself isn\\'t greasy at all, but just crispy from being pressed; the beef salami and the bologna were meaty and tasty, and I loved the simplicity of them only being topped with mustard.  I also had to get their hand-mixed soda, so I got their special cherry soda - it was delicious!  Ms. Sharon was super sweet and was super informative, and she had a great sense of humor.  The place has been featured on magazines and on food shows, but the fame doesn\\'t seem to faze them at all (there was even a local newspaper photographer who was there, just taking pictures).  Definitely a cute little gem to check out :D\\n\\n+the Wilensky \\'Special\\'\\n+sour pickles\\n+handmixed cherry soda\\n+ask for Ms. Sharon :DClassic - need to get the bologna sandwich, and the soda isn\\'t bad either!Damn this place is so great. The decor is very friendly\\u200b and you can\\'t\\u200b beat those prices! Definitely coming back.If you just came out of JAIL after 35 years...come here!\\n\\nYou\\'ve lost your hair, your belly is protruding, you don\\'t remember the last time you actually said: \"Wow, this is delicious!\", your children have all grown up and moved far away from you...\\nWell, then, THIS IS THE BEST PLACE FOR YOU!\\nCrudy old resto, that hasn\\'t changed in the last 40 years (probably ever!), their food is what a 2 year old would love to get their hands on. Comfort food for people that haven\\'t developed ANY sophistication or taste...\\n\\nOld waitress throws the food on your place at the counter, and rolls her eyes if you don\\'t drink a cola and want water or don\\'t finish their DISGUSTINGLY TASTELESS CHEAP \"FOOD\".\\n\\nGood place to do a photo shoot, shoot a movie that takes place in the 1940s, but TERRIBLE PLACE to eat at.\\n\\nLived 2 streets away from this place and went there cause a friend dragged me there saying her father used to love it there as a kid, well he\\'s dead now, don\\'t know if it\\'s related to his terrible eating habits, but it definitely didn\\'t help.\\n\\nGo for the look of the place, the time warp feeling, but STAY AWAY FROM THE \"FOOD\".\\n\\nVisited July 2013Fantastic 80 year old sandwich shop (see Risa D\\'s review for more history) - If a place has been doing the same thing for that long, they\\'re probably doing it right!\\n\\nDrop by when you\\'re in the neighbourhood, find a seat at the bar (if there\\'s none free, it won\\'t take long for one to free-up), and order a \"special with cheese\" and some pickles. There\\'re not big - hey, the place is called \"Light Lunch\" - but after two I\\'m usually good.\\n\\nWhile you\\'re at it get yourself a soda - it\\'s made with the syrup right at the bar there in front of you. I like the cherry or root beer flavours, but there are plenty of old-school options to choose from.Fellow Yelper Tim K. told me about this amazing place called Wilensky\\'s where you can get a super cheap sandwich. He talked it up so much, I have to say I was disappointed. But what the food lacked, the place made up for in charm. The place has been around forever and it seems like the staff has, too. We talked about all the cool stuff on their walls, like the low prices of housing in the 30\\'s. My family is from Montreal, so I\\'m pretty sure my grandparents hung out here in their childhood, so it\\'s pretty cool that it\\'s still around.As a fan of time travel, this place fits my needs perfectly. When you walk into this deli you are transported into a 30s? 50s? 60s? style deli with classic stools and counter top. Their signature sandwich is great for a snack and is perfect to satisfy the hunger of those who are not well read in historical interior decorations. \\n\\nSeating was limited but I got mine to go as there are plenty of outdoor seating in the neighborhood and I was here during a nice fall day and was not given any indication that the weather in Montreal will not always be pleasant, so I assume that this is year round.\\n\\n My only gripe is that this place was not fully embracing their historical decor and offering soda for nickel and candy for a copper... and giving 1 cent coins in change.Nice historical place. The food is nothing special and the options are very limited, but it\\'s just fun to go for a quick cheap snack. It\\'s biggest attribute is definitely its classic decor.Wilensky\\'s is Montreal nostalgia and heritage at its finest. It has been in business since 1932 and is very much a family run business. If you have ever read Mordecai Richler\\'s \"The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz\" then you will relate to this lunch counter from a bygone era. It is a relic from the days when the Main was the area where Jewish families settled, lived and ran businesses. Most have moved on, however, Wilensky\\'s remains.\\n\\nThe menu is simple and straight forward. The special is an all-beef salami\\\\/bologna sandwich with light mustard served on a bun, on top of a single napkin (no plate) price $4.70, no tipping. All specials contain mustard. They also serve cokes, cherry colas and cream sodas made from syrup, old fashioned style, mixed in front of you, at the counter. There are pickles and assorted sausages available as well. The sign says light lunch and this is precisely what it is, more or less an excellent snack, and no frills. \\n\\nThe ambiance is definitely unique. There are about 6-8 stools at a lunch counter. The walls are plastered with newspaper clippings and articles from decades passed. There are photos of famous people who have stopped in. My eye caught one with Anthony Bourdain from CNN. There is also a book shelf that sells second hand books and CD\\'s for a buck.  I actually found some incredible CD\\'s here. Anytime that I am in the Plateau\\\\/Mile End district I stop by Wilensky\\'s for a special and nostalgic blast from the past of a Montreal I remember not so long ago. Classic experience!No place quite like this I\\'ve ever seen or been to.  Plopped a squat on the bar and ordered me a cream soda and a bologna sandwich.  Tried to act all discreet like we\\'ve been here before.  Couldn\\'t help myself and struck up a conversation with what appeared to be the boss, and she could not have been more friendly!\\n\\nI can see why they call this light lunch, don\\'t come here if you\\'re extremely hungry.  Unless of course you want to eat 3 bologna sandwiches.  But you very well may want to after you\\'ve tried these!  Best bologna sandwich I\\'ve ever had.This is no light lunch especially if you take down three of their special salami sandwiches.  Absolutely to die for pressed sandwich with mustard was mouth watering.  I could go back every day.  After you are through there, walk a block up the street to Fairmont Bagel for one of the best bagels you will ever have.  You may need a three hour walk after leaving that block but a can\\'t miss in Montreal.  And don\\'t forget to order one of their custom sodas, cherry coke, Creme soda, etc..to wash down your salami.Nothing fancy, but fricken amazing!\\n\\nThey may have other items, but for years -- it\\'s all about the Wilensky\\'s fried bologna sandwich.  Mustard, cheese, on crappy white bread and then pressed together kinda of like a panini.  OMG - so dang good!!!\\n\\nMake sure to order 2 of them...you\\'ll want one for dessert after you\\'ve inhaled the first one.  \\n\\nI don\\'t know how or why they are so good...I\\'ve tried to make them, and it is just missing that certain jenesequa.\\n\\nWhen I am in Montreal to see my family, I have a short-list of must haves when I am in town -- and this is one critical stop!Family owned & operated. Wonderful people, offering a spectacular sandwich. Crusty bread lathered with mustard, expertly seasoned salami & bologna and oozy Swiss cheese all pressed flat. (Can be ordered with cheddar or without cheese.)\\n\\nThe storefront & interior capture a style and warmth that is hard to find these days. You feel like you\\'ve stepped back in time and it feels great.J\\'ai pas tant aimé le Spécial : c\\'est juste de la charcuterie chaude et trop salée dans un muffin anglais et de la moutarde jaune et ça pour 4$!  Par contre le lieu (autant la devanture que le bar) fait que je ne regrette pas d\\'y être allée je pourrai même y retourner pour goûter un soda float.One of the things I miss most about Montreal.\\n\\nDoes one thing, and does it well, without any pretense to being anything else.\\n\\nThey also serve a mean egg cream soda (n.b. contains no actual egg or cream).Small bologna and salami sandwich, toasted with cheese, mustard, and mayo. Very cheap and good. They also have good pickles, and soda made the old fashioned way. Really cool little shop. Check it out.A Montreal legend which has been there FOREVER. Very colourful staff full of stories if you can get them talking. \\n\\nTry the Wilensky\\'s Special with swiss cheese, sour pickle, and one of their sodas. I recommend the cherry cola.I love this place so much. It really does feel like going back in time. There aren\\'t many places that can do just one thing, and do that thing well. \\n\\nThe service is friendly but to the point. This isn\\'t a place you spend hours at. Just walk in, take a seat at the bar, and order a special, a milk cream (cola is delicious!) and some pickles. Be sure to add a little extra mustard if that\\'s your kind of thing. \\n\\nDon\\'t ask for your special to be cut in half, or for any special requests. Just accept that this place has been around almost 85 years, making the same specials, and maybe the way they do things is for a reason.When I told one of my DC friends I was going to Montreal, he said if there was one thing we had to do was to try the \"deep-fat fried\" bologna sandwich at Wilensky\\'s. After looking it up and seeing good reviews from more than one celebrity chef, we had to go.\\n\\nWe walked in and it still has a 1920s feel to it like the kind of delis you see in the old movies. A funny, old man greeted us and ave us their special within literally 30 seconds on a napkin. The sandwich was NOT deep-fat friend and it was literally a bun heated on a panini with layers of meat and kraft slice cheese. I loved it, but I definitely wouldn\\'t give it the best sandwich I ever had award like one celebrity chef called it.Wilensky\\'s.. en un mot: Institution. \\n\\nLa recette magique du parfait sandwich, simple et délicieux, c\\'est eux qui l\\'ont. Bon je suis un peu biaisé, puisque Wilensky et moi retournons à mon enfance. Eh oui, je mange le même sandwich depuis plus de 25 ans. Par contre eux, la font depuis genre 85 ans.\\n\\nMa commande:\\n- Un spécial Wilensky avec fromage (des fois 2)\\n- 1 cornichon à l\\'aneth\\n- un pepperoni\\n\\nIls font de délicieux sodas maison, mais j\\'essaie de me tenir loin des boissons gazeuses.\\n\\nL\\'endroit a, jusqu\\'à mon plus lointain souvenir, toujours eu le même décor. Vient de là une grande partie de son charme.\\n\\nJe donne 6 étoiles à Wilensky bien sûr!Wilensky\\'s. Montréal institution. If it ever shots down, Montréal will mourn its passing. An old cigar shop from the 1920s (I think) that offered some light lunches. Now it\\'s all they do. They serve fried baloney sammiches, old syrup and fountain pop and homemade pickels. The place seats 8, standing room available by they freezer. Deal with it. This place is awesome.Yes the decor is terrific; retro, old, vintage. \\nThat sandwich is gross.  I\\'m not a big fan of bologna to begin with (not sure who is...), I felt almost bad because the staff is pretty watchful, but I couldn\\'t get through half of it. Fried bologna yuck! Not for me.I had heard about Wilensky\\'s LIght Lunch for quite awhile before stopping by on a recent trip. Friends had suggested that Moishe\\'s and Schwartz\\'s are the typical go-to spots, but that Wilensky\\'s does something completely different. Upon completing my first trip, I couldn\\'t agree more. \\n\\nThis is a small restaurant, a shop made up of only ten stools, four to five people working the counter doing their respective job, and that\\'s it. Since it has been open for eighty years, you can see signs all over the wall for what their signature salami sandwich has cost over the years. \\n\\nThe owner suggested the salami sandwich with swiss over the one with cheddar, but I tried both (and confirmed her suggestion). It\\'s a thick-cut salami that reminded me more of bologna and it\\'s served on a cornmeal based bread with a tiny dab of yellow mustard on it. The sandwiches are small, but given their price of $4, it\\'s a fair deal and two made for a full meal for me. I washed it down with a chocolate egg cream, a true delight not nearly served enough these days. \\n\\nIt\\'s a cheap, solid lunch that hit the spot and would my go to suggestion for Montreal visitors looking for a lunch-time taste of the city.One of the last remnants of the Jewish area in Mile End. Wilensky\\'s \"light lunch\" isnt...its smooshed beef baloney and cheese on a roll. All of it pressed like a Cuban. The place is more of a museum than a Jewish deli.So glad I came here for lunch while in town. I ran the gamut on pickles, hand crafted cream soda, karnatzels, and a couple of Wilensky Specials with cheese. I think the only thing on the menu I didn\\'t eat is a hot dog. The staff and even the patrons were all very friendly and welcoming. Nothing special but done perfectly which is what has made them great for so many years. I might have to try and recreate some specials back home in the states.I almost wasn\\'t going to eat here cause I *just* had a bagel from Fairmount next door but vacationing is not awesome until you\\'ve stuffed yourself to exploding capacity.\\n\\nMy sister and I ran in, ordered a special,  and ran out. I didn\\'t expect much but I took one bite and HOLY MOLY is baloney or whatever is in that sandwich really THAT GOOD? IT was soft and hot and delicious. I really have no idea what I ate, but it was freakin awesome. Prob one of the best things I ate in Montreal. Yup.\\n\\nThe actual place is small with less than 15 counter seats. I didn\\'t really notice too much about the place other than the cup of dried sausage they had next to the register for 50 cents. I should have gotten one.I was told that this is a MUST on every first timer\\'s trip to Montreal so I had to stop by.\\nI was pleasantly surprised by such a simple yet delicious meal. Although I would never eat bologna as an adult, it was somehow okay in this sandwich. The sandwich itself is nothing special, I think all the hype is about the location and ambiance. I was able to get a seat at the counter and the staff and regulars were very nice. It\\'s definitely an interesting place if you are in the area.Wilensky\\'s is fucking glorious.  There\\'s no other way to describe it.\\n\\nYes, I realize it\\'s touristy (now) and it\\'s riding on the whole nostalgia factor and the stern rules gives it a unique charm.\\n\\nBut seriously, the Wilensky\\'s Special is probably the best $3.90 you can spend on food.  The skill is in the simplicity - grilled beef salami and bologna with mustard on a flat-grilled kaiser roll with your choice of cheddar or swiss.\\n\\nI rolled by for lunch and grabbed a Special with some pickles and one of their house-made sodas.  Then I went patio drinking at Dieu Du Ciel down the street.... then I came back to grab  another Special while drunk.  And it was damned good on both counts.\\n\\nIt\\'s impossible to not like this place.'"
